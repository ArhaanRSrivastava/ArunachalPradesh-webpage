            <p class="information">
                Arunachal Pradesh, also known as the "Land of Dawn-Lit Mountains," lies in northeastern India.
                Characterized by its mountainous terrain, lush green valleys, and numerous rivers, the state borders
                Bhutan to the west, China to the north, and Myanmar to the east. Itanagar serves as the capital city.

                Nestled in the Himalayan foothills, Arunachal Pradesh boasts a varied landscape. Most of the state is
                mountainous, with some plains in the south. Elevations range from a few hundred meters to over 7,000
                meters. Major rivers like the Kameng, Subansiri, and Siang flow through the state, eventually draining
                into the Brahmaputra River.

                Arunachal Pradesh is a biodiversity hotspot, rich with a variety of forests, including tropical,
                subtropical, temperate, and alpine ecosystems. Over 4,000 species of flowering plants, 600 species of
                birds, and numerous mammals, reptiles, and insects call this state home. Around 80% of the state is
                covered by forests, with protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries established to
                conserve this rich tapestry of life. The climate varies depending on elevation, with lower areas
                experiencing hot and humid summers and mild winters, while higher elevations are colder with subarctic
                climates. The state receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon season, from May to September.
